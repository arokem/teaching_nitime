# Nitime Workshop

## Stanford University - December 5th 2012

In this (short!) workshop, we will get acquainted with the [nitime software library](http://nipy.org/nitime). This is a library for the analysis of time-series data from neuroscience experiments, with a focus on clear object-oriented design for easy and customizable use.

## Topics we will (try to) cover:

- Brief introduction to scientific computing in Python. See also [this essay](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html)

- Brief intro to the structure and logic of the library. [Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/arokem/teaching_nitime/master/Introduction_to_nitime.ipynb). 

### Examples:

- Event-related analysis using nitime.  [Notebook](https://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/arokem/teaching_nitime/master/event_related_analysis.ipynb).

- Multi-channel analysis using nitime.

## If you want to follow along: 

If you want to follow along on your own computer, please install the following software:

- **The Enthought Python Distribution**. This should provide you with all of the software dependencies of nitime. You can download [EPD Free](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php), which is smaller and is free for anyone, or [EPD for academics](http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php), which is free for academics and more comprehensive.

- **Nitime**. Please follow the instructions [here](http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nitime/users/install.html) to install using `easy_install`, or to install from the source code. To download the most recent state of the source-code for nitime, go [here](https://github.com/nipy/nitime/downloads). Then, follow the instructions [here](http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nitime/users/install.html#building-from-source).

- Please download the **teaching_nitime** repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/arokem/teaching_nitime/archive/master.zip), or by cloning/forking it with git. We will go over these notebooks together during the presentation. For the third notebook, you will need to download electrophysiological data from [the CRCNS data-sharing website](http://crcns.org/data-sets/vc/pvc-3).
